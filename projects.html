            <ul>
                <li>Micro text editor: a modern and intuitive terminal-based text editor. Micro runs in your terminal but feels like a standard GUI editor. It has modern keybindings, mouse support, and good out-of-the-box defaults, including a built-in linter. Micro is distributed as a single binary, which makes it easy to install. <a href="https://micro-editor.github.io">Website</a> <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/micro">GitHub</a>.</li><br>
                <li>GPeg: an incremental PEG parsing machine. GPeg is a library that implements a dynamic incremental parser. It will compile a PEG into a parsing machine language, which can be executed by a small virtual machine. It supports efficient incremental updates to the input text by using a novel incremental parsing algorithm. GPeg also supports some context-sensitive grammars via backreferences. This project was developed as part of my undergraduate senior thesis research. <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/gpeg">GitHub</a> <a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/preprints/gpeg_sle21.pdf">Publication</a> <a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/talks/gpeg_sle21_slides.pdf">Slides</a> <a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/notes/yedidia_thesis.pdf">Thesis</a>.</li>
                <li>Perforator: get perf metrics for individual functions. Perforator is a tool for recording performance metrics in a program. Linux's perf is a great tool for this (it records many different metrics, such as branch mispredictions, cache accesses, etc.), but it records over the entire duration of a program. Perforator allows you to record those same metrics over an individual function. Perforator works by using ptrace and debugging breakpoints -- it places a breakpoint at the beginning of the function to inspect. When the traced process arrives there, it begins enables the system's hardware performance counters, and scans the stack to place a breakpoint at the return address. When the return address breakpoint is reached, the system's performance counters are read and disabled. <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/perforator">GitHub</a>.</li>
                <li>Literate: a flexible literate programming system. Literate programming is a style of programming invented by Donald Knuth where prose and code are interleaved. Knuth originally wrote a tool called CWeb for literate programming with C. Literate is a new tool for Literate programming with any language. It generates HTML documents instead of PDF, uses Markdown, and produces readable code (including auto-generated comments). It can also report compiler errors back to the original source code in the Literate document. Literate is supported by default by Micro, and there is also a Vim plugin. Some popular blog posts have been written using Literate. <a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/literate">Website</a> <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/literate">GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/literate.vim">Vim plugin</a>.</li>
                <li>Eget: easily install pre-built binaries from GitHub. Lots of projects provide pre-built binaries via GitHub releases, but downloading these is annoyingly manual. Eget is a CLI tool that automates this process. Given a repository, it fetches the latest release, scans the assets for a matching system, downloads the archive and extracts a binary. If configured, it may also place the binary on your PATH. If it runs into difficulties, it will ask the user for input. I now use Eget to install all my essential dev tools when I am using a new machine. <code>eget zyedidia/micro; eget ogham/exa; eget sharkdp/fd; eget BurntSushi/ripgrep; eget neovim/neovim</code>... <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/eget">GitHub</a>.</li>
                <li>Sregx: a structural regular expression tool. Structural regular expressions are a cool idea from Rob Pike. The idea is to chain regular expressions together with various commands so that you can easily parse/extract information from text. Many unix tools have a built-in assumption that text is delimited by lines. Structural regular expressions allow you to generalize -- you can extract lines, or you can extract different kinds of blocks with different delimiters each specified as regular expressions. Sregx is a tool for manipulating text with structural regular expressions. It supports all of the original commands, plus some extra features. <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/sregx">GitHub</a>.</li>
                <li>Rvasm: a basic RV32i RISC-V assembler. An assembler that supports the RV32i subset of RISC-V plus CSR and privilege extensions. Outputs flat machine code files from input assembly code. <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/rvasm">GitHub</a>.</li>
                <li>Flare: a syntax highlighting library built on GPeg. Flare provides an easy syntax to write syntax highlighting grammars and integrates them with the GPeg incremental parser for efficient incremental re-highlighting. Flare grammars support including other languages, backreferences, and the full PEG syntax. <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/flare">GitHub</a>.</li>
                <li>Tzu: an experiment in unpredictability. Tzu is a program that uses ptrace to randomly perturb processes. It was built to test the theory from <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-sun.pdf">this paper</a> about unpredictability as OS security. Unfortunately, when I run big programs with tzu like web browsers, the unpredictability causes too much instability. <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/tzu">GitHub</a>.</li>
